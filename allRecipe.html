                            <br>4 – 10 Thai chilies – when you fry the chilies, they aren’t as spicy</br>
                            <br>1 tablespoon oil for frying</br>
                            <br>1 teaspoon of oyster sauce</br>
                            <br>1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce</br>

                          <br>1/2 teaspoon sugar</br>
                          <br>1 handful of Thai holy basil leaves (really try to get holy basil) </br>

                    <h4> INSTRUCTION FOR THE BASIL CHICKEN: </h4>
                    <li>1.  Cut the chicken into small bite sized pieces.</li>
                      <li><br> 2.  Rinse and peel the garlic and chilies, and pound them in a mortar and pestle (alternatively you can just mince them with a knife).
                        <br> They don't need to be super fine, you just want to bring out the oils and flavors from the garlic and chilies.</li>
                      <li><br> 3.  Pluck a good sized handful of holy basil leaves off the stems.</li>
                      <li><br> 4.  Now it's time to start cooking. Heat your wok on high heat, and add about 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan.</li>
                      <li><br> 5.  When the oil is hot, add the chilies and garlic. Stir fry them for about 20 seconds or so until they get really fragrant, 
                        <br>but don't let them burn or get too dry.</li>
                      <li><br> 6.  Toss in your chicken. Keep stir frying continuously. 
                        <br>At this stage you want to continue to stir and cook your chicken until it's just about fully cooked all the way through
                        <br> (depending on the size pieces of chicken and how hot your fire is, it should take about 2 - 3 minutes). 
                        <br>If it starts to get dry, add just a tiny splash of water.!</li>
                      <li><br> 7.  Add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon light soy sauce, ½ teaspoon sugar, and finally a splash of dark soy sauce.
                        <br> Keep stir frying for about another 30 seconds.</li>
                      <li><br> 8. Grab a handful of holy basil, toss it into the pan, fold it into the chicken, and then immediately turn off the heat 
                        <br>(if you're using an electric stove, you'll want to remove the pan from the burner). 
                        <br>The holy basil really only needs to cook for about 5 seconds, and it will continue to wilt and cook from the existing heat of the chicken. 
                        <br>This step is important because if you cook the basil for too long, it loses some of its glorious flavor and gets slightly chewy.</li>

<h3>INSTRUCTION: </h3>
    <h4>THE SHELL:</h4>
    <li>Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.</li>
        <h4>THE FILLING : </h4>
        <li> 1.the rice flour, sugar and salt together until there are no more clumps of flour. 
          <br>Add coconut milk and whisk until sugar is dissolved. Easy peasy!<br>
          2.*Both batters can be made in advance and stored in the fridge. Bring it out to room temp before using.
          <br> If the shell batter has thickened up too much, you can add a bit of water to thin it out so it pours easily. The batter should have a runny consistency<br>
          3.Prepare the toppings and a cooling rack.</li>
            <h4>TO COOK : </h4>
            <li>1.Heat the pan at 325°F. To test pan for readiness, sprinkle a bit of water onto the pan, 
              <br>and if it sizzles away immediately it's hot enough. Brush half the holes with coconut oil. 
              <br> *I like to make only half a pan at a time in the beginning because you'll likely be a bit slow and clumsy to start, 
              <br>and it's just more manageable and less hectic to deal with a few at a time.</li><p>
              <li> 2.Add ½ Tbsp of the shell batter into the pre-heated holes.
                <br> Then add 1 tsp of the filling by dunking the teaspoon right into the middle of the shell and wiggle it slightly.
                <br> Let them cook for a minute or so, meanwhile, fill the rest of the pan.</li>
                <li>3.After a minute or two of cooking, the cakes should be partially set, go ahead and add your toppings. <br>
                  If you're using heavier toppings like corn or taro, and they sink too much into the cakes,
                  <br> just let the cakes set a bit more before topping. </li>
                  <li>4.Continue to let them cook until the bottom is crispy and golden brown, and the top is no longer runny, about 5 mins. 
                    <br>Give them at least 5 minutes to cook, do not rush them, that is how you get crispy bottoms. 
                    <br>If the bottom is done but the top still needs more cooking, you can cover the pan with a pot lid to steam the top for 1 minute. 
                    <br>To test doneness, tilt the pan slightly, and if the top doesn't run, then it's done. 
                    <br>Tips: Feel free to adjust the temperature of the pan as needed during the cooking process</li>
                    <li>5.Remove the cakes by pushing them up with a toothpick or skewer, and scooping them out with a spoon. 
                      <br>Place on a rack to cool for a few minutes just so you don't burn yourself, but you want to eat these while they're still warm and crispy.
                      <br> These do NOT keep well as they go mushy and soggy real fast!! 
                      <br>Note: I'm only using the toothpick to push the cakes up because I don't want to scratch the nonstick pan with the spoon,
                      <br>but if you're using cast iron, you can just use the spoon alone.</li></p>

    <h3> INSTRUCTION : </h3>
    <li>1.  Reduce ¾ cup coconut milk until thick and coconut oil starts to separate from the coconut milk <br>
      <br>(if the oil doesn’t separate after it has reduced until very thick, it's okay, just proceed with the recipe). </li>
      <li><br> 2.   Add curry paste and sauce, stirring constantly over medium heat for about 2 minutes until aromatic.
        <br> If paste sticks to the bottom of the pan, you can deglaze with a little bit of the remaining coconut milk.  </li>
      <li><br> 3.   Add chicken thigh and stir to mix with the paste. (See below if using chicken breast).</li>
      <li><br> 4.   Add kaffir lime leaves, chicken stock, remaining 1 cup of coconut milk, palm sugar and 1 Tbsp fish sauce. 
        <br>Bring to a simmer and let simmer gently for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is fork tender.</li>
      <li><br> 5.   Once the curry is done simmering, add bamboo shoots and bring to a boil. 
        <br>If you prefer your peppers to be more cooked, add them at this stage.
        <br> Once boiling, remove from heat.</li>
      <li><br>6.    Taste and add more fish sauce and/or sugar as needed.</li>
      <li><br>7.    Stir in Thai basil and spur chilies or bell peppers.</li>
      <li><br>8.    Serve with jasmine rice</li>


      <h4> INSTRUCTION FOR CURRY PASTE: </h4>
      <li>1.  Toast coriander seeds by adding them to a dry sauté pan and stir constantly over medium-high heat until the seeds are aromatic and slightly darkened, about 4 minutes.
        <br> Cool on a plate. Repeat with the cumin seeds. </li>
        <li><br> 2.   Using a mortar and pestle, grind toasted coriander seeds, toasted cumin seeds, and white peppercorns into a fine powder.
          <br>Remove from mortar and set aside. </li>
        <li><br> 3.   Cut at least 8 green Thai chilies in half horizontally and, with a paring knife, 
          <br>scrape off and discard the seeds and pith, then finely chop along with the remaining chilies.
          <br> Note: The seeds and pith are removed from some of the chilies to tone down the heat, 
          <br>you can remove seeds from all of the green chilies if you wish to tone it down even more</li>
        <li><br> 4.  Add chopped chilies and salt to a heavy-duty mortar and pestle; pound into a fine paste.
          <br> If the mixture feels too wet at any point, add some of the ground spices to absorb the liquid.</li>
        <li><br> 5.   Add basil leaves; pound into a fine paste.</li>
        <li><br>6.   Add lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime zest, and cilantro roots; pound into a fine paste.</li>
        <li><br>7.    Add shallots, garlic, and any remaining ground spices; pound into a fine paste.</li>
        <li><br>8.    Add shrimp paste and pound to mix.</li>

                    <li><br> 2.  Now add 3 egg whites and 1/2 cup of sugar to a jug or bowl 
                      <br> and whisk for about 5 to 10 minutes until you are left with a thick cream.</li>
                    <li><br> 3.   Next we need to make the crepe batter. 
                      <br>By now the egg shell powder we made earlier should have settled at the bottom of the mortar and pestle. 
                      <br>We just want to spoon out the water only into a mixing bowl, and then add 50g mung bean flour, 100g of rice flour, 1 egg, 150g of sugar, and 1/2 tbsp of coco powder 
                      <br>to the bowl and whisk together until there are no lumps in the mixture.</li>
                    <li><br> 4.  Now heat a non stick pan on a medium-low heat, and when hot, pour a small amount of batter onto the pan, and spread it out in a circular motion,
                      <br> so that you have a very thin layer of batter.
                      <br> Let the crepe cook for about 20 seconds or so, then spoon on some of the whipped cream we made, 
                      <br>along with some of the golden egg yolk threads.
                      <br> When the crepe is crispy and light brown, which shouldn’t take more than a couple of minutes of cooking to achieve, 
                      <br>carefully fold the crepe in half and remove from the pan. Repeat this process until all of your batter has been used up.</li>

                           <li>1.  To make the sweet potato dumplings, mash the steamed sweet potato and add sticky rice flour. 
                               <br>Knead until combined into a sandy textured dough. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the dough comes together with a sheen. 
                               <br>This is typically 5-6 teaspoons. Roll into small marble sized balls.</li>
                             <li><br> 2.   Prepare the pandan bua loy as above by mixing the pandan water with the sticky rice flour. 
                                 <br>Add more flour if the dough is too thin, or more pandan water if too thick. 
                                 <br>Roll the dough into marble sized balls.</li>
                             <li><br> 3.   Make the coconut milk soup by adding the coconut milk, both kinds of sugar, salt, and knotted pandan leaf to a small saucepan 
                                 <br>and simmer for a few minutes. Do not boil. Discard pandan leaf.</li>
                             <li><br> 4.  Bring a pot of water to the boil and tip in all of the dumplings. 
                                 <br>Boil for 30 seconds to a minute, or until all of the balls are floating. 
                                 <br>Strain with a spider or mesh strainer and divvy up amongst some bowls. Pour the warm sweetened coconut milk over and serve.</li>

                              <h4>Prepping: </h4>
                               <li>1. Toast the peanuts in a pan for 10-15 minutes over a medium to medium-low heat. It takes a while to cook the raw peanuts thoroughly. When done, let the peanuts cool. Peel the green mango and shred it with the shredder until you hit the single large seed. Slice the peppers and shallots thinly.</li>
                                <h4>Tossing:</h4>
                                <li>1. Put all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Taste to see if you need lime juice. With a natural product like mango, the sourness varies depending on the variety and how green the mango is. Add lime juice as much as you like, start with a small amount first and keep adding until you hit the right spot. I usually start with ⅓ of a lime. Adjust the taste to your liking. Add ground chili for a spicier salad. If your salad is very spicy, you may need more seasonings.</li>

                             <li>1.  Gut and clean the fish, then cut into medium sized pieces. Bring a pot of water to boil, then boil the fish for about 5 - 10 minutes until fully cooked.</li>
                               <li><br> 2.   Remove the fish from the water, drain fully, and leave to cool</li>
                               <li><br> 3.   Once the fish is cool, carefully take off the skin and debone all the meat from the fish, and flake the fish in your fingers so it's almost like deboned minced fish. Discard the bones and skin.</li>
                               <li><br> 4.  Set aside the fish for later.</li>
                               
                               <h4> INSTRUCTION FOR CURRY PASTE: </h4>
                               <li>1.  Cut off the ends of the lemongrass and tear off the outer few layers, then shave the lemongrass into small pieces. Cut the turmeric into small pieces as well. </li>
                                 <li><br> 2.   In a mortar and pestle (or alternatively a food processor), start with a pinch of salt, then pound the dry chilies first for about 10 minutes.</li>
                                 <li><br> 3.   Then add the lemongrass, turmeric, garlic, and peppercorns, and pound for about 30 minutes until a relatively smooth paste.</li>
                                 <li><br> 4.  Once the paste is pretty smooth, the final step is to add the shrimp paste, and pound and mix for another 5 minutes.</li>
                                 <li><br> 5.   Set aside.</li>

                                 <h4> INSTRUCTION FOR THE CURRY : </h4>
                                 <li>1.  In a large pot or sauce pan, add all the coconut milk and curry paste, then turn on medium heat. </li>
                                   <li><br> 2.   Stir gently, and only in one direction, making sure all the curry paste dissolves into the coconut milk.</li>
                                   <li><br> 3.   Add the minced fish, season with salt, and tear the kaffir lime leaves in half and add them to the curry</li>
                                   <li><br> 4.  Keep stirring in one direction, and once it comes to a boil, turn down the heat. You don't want the curry to boil strongly. Keep stirring gently for about 5 minutes once it comes to a boil.</li>
                                   <li><br> 5.   Taste test for flavor, you may need to add more salt. You're done.</li>

                                            <li>1.  Begin by making the curry paste. Peel the stems off all the chilies, then add them to a blender or food processor.</li>
                                              <li><br> 2.  Peel the garlic, and shallots, and cut the turmeric into pieces, and toss them all into the blender.</li>
                                              <li><br> 3.   Add about a cup of water, and blend for a few seconds until pureed.</li>
                                              <li><br> 4.  NOTE: Be warned that turmeric stains, so don't use a nice blender!</li>
            
                                              <h4> INSTRUCTION FOR THE SOUP : </h4>
                                            <li>1. To prepare the green papaya, first peel the outer green skin, rinse it in water to remove the sap, then shave off thin bite sized pieces of papaya so you have thin wedges. Cut the papaya like you're whittling a piece of wood. Then set aside.</li>
                                              <li><br> 2.  For the limes, slice and squeeze them into a separate bowl.</li>
                                              <li><br> 3.  Put a big soup pot on the stove and turn to medium heat, and add in all the curry paste you just blended.</li>
                                              <li><br> 4.  Add 2 liters of water to the soup, using some of the water to rinse out the blender, and add to the pot.</li>
                                              <li><br>5.  Add the shrimp paste, and stir the soup to make sure the shrimp paste fully dissolves.</li>
                                              <li><br>6.  Take the green papaya, add it all to the soup, stir quickly, then put the cover on to bring to a boil.</li>
                                              <li><br> 7. Once the gaeng som is boiling, gently add the pieces of fish</li>
                                              <li><br> 8. But here's the Mea's cooking trick - don't stir the soup until the fish is fully cooked. If you stir the soup when the fish is still raw, your soup will taste fishy (according to my mom cooking practice).</li>
                                              <li><br> 9. Boil the soup, without stirring, for about 5 - 8 minutes.</li>
                                              <li><br> 10.  When the fish is finished cooking, you can stir gently, and then turn off the stove pretty quickly so you don't overcook the fish.</li>
                                              <li><br> 11.  Once your heat is off, it's time to season with salt and lime juice. Add some at first, stir gently, taste test, then add more if needed.</li>
                                              <li><br> 12.Taste test until your gaeng som is sour, slightly salt, and extremely spicy.</li>
