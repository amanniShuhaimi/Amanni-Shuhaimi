<h3>INSTRUCTION: </h3>
    <h4>THE SHELL:</h4>
    <li>Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.</li>
        <h4>THE FILLING : </h4>
        <li> 1.the rice flour, sugar and salt together until there are no more clumps of flour. Add coconut milk and whisk until sugar is dissolved. Easy peasy!<br>
          2.*Both batters can be made in advance and stored in the fridge. Bring it out to room temp before using. If the shell batter has thickened up too much, you can add a bit of water to thin it out so it pours easily. The batter should have a runny consistency<br>
          3.Prepare the toppings and a cooling rack.</li>
            <h4>TO COOK : </h4>
            <li>1.Heat the pan at 325°F. To test pan for readiness, sprinkle a bit of water onto the pan, and if it sizzles away immediately it's hot enough. Brush half the holes with coconut oil. <br> *I like to make only half a pan at a time in the beginning because you'll likely be a bit slow and clumsy to start, and it's just more manageable and less hectic to deal with a few at a time.</li><p>
              <li> 2.Add ½ Tbsp of the shell batter into the pre-heated holes. Then add 1 tsp of the filling by dunking the teaspoon right into the middle of the shell and wiggle it slightly (see video for this technique). Let them cook for a minute or so, meanwhile, fill the rest of the pan.</li>
                <li>3.After a minute or two of cooking, the cakes should be partially set, go ahead and add your toppings. If you're using heavier toppings like corn or taro, and they sink too much into the cakes, just let the cakes set a bit more before topping. </li>
                  <li>4.Continue to let them cook until the bottom is crispy and golden brown, and the top is no longer runny, about 5 mins. Give them at least 5 minutes to cook, do not rush them, that is how you get crispy bottoms. If the bottom is done but the top still needs more cooking, you can cover the pan with a pot lid to steam the top for 1 minute. To test doneness, tilt the pan slightly, and if the top doesn't run, then it's done. Tips: Feel free to adjust the temperature of the pan as needed during the cooking process</li>
                    <li>5.Remove the cakes by pushing them up with a toothpick or skewer, and scooping them out with a spoon. Place on a rack to cool for a few minutes just so you don't burn yourself, but you want to eat these while they're still warm and crispy. These do NOT keep well as they go mushy and soggy real fast!! Note: I'm only using the toothpick to push the cakes up because I don't want to scratch the nonstick pan with the spoon, but if you're using cast iron, you can just use the spoon alone.</li></p>

                              <h4>Prepping: </h4>
                               <li>1. Toast the peanuts in a pan for 10-15 minutes over a medium to medium-low heat. It takes a while to cook the raw peanuts thoroughly. When done, let the peanuts cool. Peel the green mango and shred it with the shredder until you hit the single large seed. Slice the peppers and shallots thinly.</li>
                                <h4>Tossing:</h4>
                                <li>1. Put all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Taste to see if you need lime juice. With a natural product like mango, the sourness varies depending on the variety and how green the mango is. Add lime juice as much as you like, start with a small amount first and keep adding until you hit the right spot. I usually start with ⅓ of a lime. Adjust the taste to your liking. Add ground chili for a spicier salad. If your salad is very spicy, you may need more seasonings.</li>
