                              <li>1.  To make the sweet potato dumplings, mash the steamed sweet potato and add sticky rice flour. 
                                  <br>Knead until combined into a sandy textured dough. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the dough comes together with a sheen. 
                                  <br>This is typically 5-6 teaspoons. Roll into small marble sized balls.</li>
                                <li><br> 2.   Prepare the pandan bua loy as above by mixing the pandan water with the sticky rice flour. 
                                    <br>Add more flour if the dough is too thin, or more pandan water if too thick. 
                                    <br>Roll the dough into marble sized balls.</li>
                                <li><br> 3.   Make the coconut milk soup by adding the coconut milk, both kinds of sugar, salt, and knotted pandan leaf to a small saucepan 
                                    <br>and simmer for a few minutes. Do not boil. Discard pandan leaf.</li>
                                <li><br> 4.  Bring a pot of water to the boil and tip in all of the dumplings. 
                                    <br>Boil for 30 seconds to a minute, or until all of the balls are floating. 
                                    <br>Strain with a spider or mesh strainer and divvy up amongst some bowls. Pour the warm sweetened coconut milk over and serve.</li>

                                <li>1.  Place 1 egg shell in a mortar and pestle and crush for a couple of minutes until the shell is broken into a powder. 
                                    <br>Then pour in 125 ml of water, mix with the crushed egg shell, and set aside.</li>
                                  <li><br> 2.  Now add 3 egg whites and 1/2 cup of sugar to a jug or bowl 
                                    <br> and whisk for about 5 to 10 minutes until you are left with a thick cream.</li>
                                  <li><br> 3.   Next we need to make the crepe batter. 
                                    <br>By now the egg shell powder we made earlier should have settled at the bottom of the mortar and pestle. 
                                    <br>We just want to spoon out the water only into a mixing bowl, and then add 50g mung bean flour, 100g of rice flour, 1 egg, 150g of sugar, and 1/2 tbsp of coco powder 
                                    <br>to the bowl and whisk together until there are no lumps in the mixture.</li>
                                  <li><br> 4.  Now heat a non stick pan on a medium-low heat, and when hot, pour a small amount of batter onto the pan, and spread it out in a circular motion,
                                    <br> so that you have a very thin layer of batter.
                                    <br> Let the crepe cook for about 20 seconds or so, then spoon on some of the whipped cream we made, 
                                    <br>along with some of the golden egg yolk threads.
                                    <br> When the crepe is crispy and light brown, which shouldn’t take more than a couple of minutes of cooking to achieve, 
                                    <br>carefully fold the crepe in half and remove from the pan. Repeat this process until all of your batter has been used up.</li>
